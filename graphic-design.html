      <p>Doing design work on my own logo is something I enjoy doing in my free time. I think its important to build recognition for yourself the same way you would a brand, and a logo that represents you is a great way to start. <p>

      <p>This logo is definitely is something that will continue to grow and evolve over time.</p>

      <p>I designed this logo for a music page run by one of my close friends, and specifically like how it came out due to the choice of background. The ripples in the sand simulating movement of sound waves compliments the idea of electronic dance music.<p>

      <p>Lastly I have chosen to include a project I did in illustrator where I recreated a landscape using nothing but the pen tool and layering different shapes. I especially like the vibrant colors in this image.<p>
