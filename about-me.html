    <section id="introduction">
      <p>I was born in Westchester, NY on the leap day of February 29th, 2000 before moving to Ridgefield, CT around the age of 5. I attended Ridgefield High School and graduated with a 4.1 weighted GPA and scored a 1440 on the SAT. After applying to many schools (I believe 12 in total) I made the decision to continue my education at The University of Miami, where I am now in my junior year.</p>

      <p>Unsure of what I would study in college, I enrolled in an AP Computer Science course my senior year of high school and found my niche. Looking to expand my frontend capabilities beyond strictly code, I also began to develop skills in graphic design using tools such as illustrator and photoshop. </p>

      <p>Some of my other interests include video editing on Final Cut Pro X which has led to freelance employment, growing my investment portfolio, snowboarding, and surfing. Coming from a home up north to a school down south meant I needed a sport to satisfy each climate.</p>
