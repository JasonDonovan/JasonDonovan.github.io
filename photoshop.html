      <p>Tasked with creating a realistic magazine cover, I chose to replicate one of my favorite publishers, ESPN. <p>

      <p>I felt the original image of Lebron James as seen on the right had a great color scheme to build off from, and after extending the black background of the image to fill the entire page, I had what felt like a natural fit.</p>

      <p>As for the rest, it was only a matter of properly formatting the headlines and titles in regards to importance and adding the minor details such as code and price.</p>

      <p>This was a fun project due to the level of freedom given, where the outcome was up to the creator’s imagination. I think personally it shows my versatility in photoshop, as there are multiple effects and images clipped together into one scene.<p>

    <section id="dog-intro">
      <p>In this specific edit, the main focus was laying one photo on top of another, but being able to let the background bleed through the image on top. There was a lot to learn with blending in photoshop to produce the unique outcome.<p>
